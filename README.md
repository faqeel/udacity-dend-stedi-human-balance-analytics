# STEDI Human Balance Analytics

This project focuses on building a data lakehouse solution for the STEDI Step Trainer, a device designed to help users improve their balance.

The STEDI Step Trainer is accompanied by a mobile app that collects sensor data. This project aims to:

1. Extract data from the STEDI Step Trainer sensors and mobile app
2. Transform and curate this data into a data lakehouse solution on AWS
3. Prepare the data for use in machine learning model training

This implementation demonstrates practical application of data engineering principles and AWS technologies in a real-world scenario, preparing data for use by data scientists in machine learning model development.
